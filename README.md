# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL

## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves a deep dive into a healthcare database using SQL. The goal was to analyze patient data, treatment efficacy, hospital operations, and financial metrics to derive insights that could improve care quality and operational efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- **Database Management** (e.g., pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench)
- **Data Visualization** (Optional: Tableau, Power BI, or Python)

## 📊 Database Schema
The database includes tables such as:
- `patients` - Patient demographics and details.
- `appointments` - Appointment dates, status, and departments.
- `treatments` - Treatment records, costs, and outcomes.
- `doctors` - Doctor information and specializations.
- `prescriptions` - Medications prescribed to patients.


## 🔍 Key Analysis Questions
1.  What is the patient readmission rate?
2.  Which departments have the longest patient wait times?
3.  What are the most common treatments and their costs?
4.  How does patient satisfaction correlate with treatment outcomes?
5.  What is the average cost per patient by medical condition?
